# Meta-station mapping
# This maps Wikidata item ids for a city to a set of stations
# The city item defines the (translated) names, the stations define the geo coordinates considered
# to be part of this meta-station.
#
# Use this for:
# - cities with multiple equally important terminus stations
#
# Do not use this for:
# - cities with a single "main" station, e.g. to map the city name to that stop
# - cities with multiple important/main stations that are on the same long-distance/high-speed lines,
#   ie. where reaching one from the other is usually "cheap"
