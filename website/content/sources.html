<p>Transitous uses data from public sources in the GTFS file format.</p>

<p>We process the data to make sure it is syntactically and (mostly) semantically correct, and make the resulting GTFS files available for use again.</p>

<p>If necessary, we remove parts of the data from a source if it overlaps with a better source.
Therefore the processed version does not necessarily cover the same area as the original. Only use it in combination with the other files for the region.</p>
