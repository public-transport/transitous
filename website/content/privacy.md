# Scope

The privacy policy applies to these services:
* the web interface and APIs at routing.spline.de
* the web interface and APIs at api.transitous.org
* the routing widget embedded in the website at transitous.org

## Stored data

To be able to debug problems (crashes, high load) and prevent abuse of the service, we store the following in log files when you use Transitous through the website or an app:

- Your IP address
- Time of the request

- User-Agent header (usually name and version of the app or browser)

The requested URL may contain:

- time of the route
- selected modes transportation
- other route options
- entered station or location search queries
- selected area and time of the map visualization
- the selected public transport connection
- anything else added to the URL by you or an app you use

We collect this based on our legitimate interest of fixing software issues to keep the service running.

## Duration

The log files are kept for up to 2 days, and deleted afterwards.
