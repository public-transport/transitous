The API provided by Transitous can be used for free, but we recommend that you let us know if you use it, so your use case can be considered in future decisions.
You can do that by <a href="https://github.com/public-transport/transitous/blob/main/website/content/_index.html#L30">adding your app to our website</a> and/or letting us know in our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23transitous:matrix.spline.de">Matrix channel</a>.

<h2>MOTIS 2 API</h2>

<p>Transitous provides the MOTIS 2 API. It is the first stable and versioned MOTIS API, and is incompatible with previous development versions of the API.</p>

<p>Our API endpoint is located at <code>https://api.transitous.org/api/v1/</code>.</p>

<h2>Client Libraries</h2>

{{< library-card name="KPublicTransport" description="A library for accessing realtime public transport data and for performing public transport journey queries." website="https://invent.kde.org/libraries/kpublictransport" tags="C++,Qt" >}}
</div>

<h2>Staging API</h2>

<p>MOTIS releases are tested with our data before deploying them to the main API endpoint.</p>

<p>You can test the almost-latest MOTIS release on <code>https://staging.api.transitous.org/api/v1/</code>.</p>

<p>Please note that full planet-wide OpenStreetMap data is not available there. The web interface is currently shared between stable and the staging instance, and does not represent the featureset available in the MOTIS version.</p>
