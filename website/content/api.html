The APIs provided by Transitous can be used for free, but we recommend that you let us know if you use them, so your use case can be considered in future decisions.
You can do that by <a href="https://github.com/public-transport/transitous/blob/main/website/content/_index.html#L30">adding your app to our website</a> and/or letting us know in our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23transitous:matrix.spline.de">Matrix channel</a>.

<h2>MOTIS 2 API</h2>

<p>Transitous provides the MOTIS 2 API. It is the first stable and versioned MOTIS API, and is incompatible with previous development versions of the API.</p>

<p>Our API endpoint is located at <code>https://api.transitous.org/api/v1/</code>.</p>

<h2>Legacy API (MOTIS 0.x)</h2>

<p>For a few more weeks, the legacy API is available at <code>https://routing.spline.de/api/</code> for compatibility with apps that have not been updated yet.</p>

<p>It will still be provided until at least 2025-02-23.</p>

<p>The data on the legacy server is no longer kept up to date.</p>
