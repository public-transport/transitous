# Transitous

**Free and open public transport routing.**

## Goal

A community-run provider-neutral international public transport routing service.

Using openly available GTFS/GTFS-RT/etc. feeds and FOSS routing engine we want to operate a
routing service that:  

* focuses on the interest of the user rather than the public transport operators
* is free to use
* values user privacy
* does not stop at borders
* aims at crowd-sourced maintenance of data feeds in the spirit of FOSS
